## Project's Goal
Try to guess the winner team

## Project's Description
We are going to use almost every data in the game. We don't know which parameter will be really effective to guess the end of the game. Our most known parameters are The gold which teams earn during the game, towers, inhibitors, wards, monsters killed for both teams, wards replacement, firstblood firstower and so on. We will explain the parameters better on our report. Our dataset is this:

There are almost 200.000 games.
We do not know about which loss function we are going to use. We will decide it later on while we are doing the project.
